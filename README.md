# Based Chromium
A hardened, portable version of Ungoogled Chromium.

# What is this?
I literally just got a download from [Portapps' Ungoogled Chromium](https://portapps.io/app/ungoogled-chromium-portable/), and hardened it for my personal use. I strongly advise that you don't use this. It's just for, and I made this repostitory just to have for archive.

# Some Advice
Mind you, if there's something that you need to understand is that offfiscating yoruself is the worst way to stay "private". It's best that you hide in plain sight. That being said the reason for this custom browser existing is strictly for portable use in public places such as libraries, coffee shops, internet cafes, etc. Now, please undersand that there are better alternatives for you to use such as [TOR](https://www.torproject.org/), or [LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net/), but I wanted something that's a little bit for my needs, so with that being said, if you want to use, fine, but I am not responsbile for your OPSEC. 

Another thing that you need to consider is that I will not be keeping this up-to-date everytime that there is a new version of Chromium. That would eat away at a lot of my time, and I have things to do, so use this with caution if you choose, which I highly discourage.
